Used DALLE

Prompt:
A Halloween-themed logo inspired by the ENIGMA logo with a spooky, gothic aesthetic. Use a dark, eerie background, and replace the original font with a bold, vintage horror style. Add details like spider webs on the corners of the letters and a small black spider hanging from one of the letters. Place two small jack-o'-lanterns with carved, sinister smiles beside the text. Surround the logo with a faint, foggy mist to create a chilling, atmospheric feel. Ensure the text layout resembles the original ENIGMA logo, making it recognizable but with a spooky twist.
