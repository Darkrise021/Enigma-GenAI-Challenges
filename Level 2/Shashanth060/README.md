To generate a spooky-themed music beat, I combined several sound files (thunder,
whispers, wind, organ, and creaking sounds) using C programming and an AI-based approach called The Markov Chain method to
sequence the sounds.
The Markov Chain method is a simple probabilistic model that can be seen as AI tool.
I was able to combine multiple spooky sounds randomly into one WAV file with a valid header, 
producing a continuous spooky beat suitable for playback
I used freesound.org to find the spooky sounds (such as thunder, whispers, wind, organ, and creaking sounds)
This was achieved entirely on my local system.
I know that using python would make this way easier but i dont know python so i had to do on C.
I included the code used
and also the sound files i used
and two different spooky music it generated named 
1) spooky_beat_1
2) spooky_beat_2
Thank you for reading.
